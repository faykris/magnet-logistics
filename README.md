## üß± State & Persistence

### State Management
- `useReducer` + `createContext` for global state
- Available actions: `LOAD_BOOKINGS`, `CREATE_BOOKING`, `DELETE_BOOKING`, `UPDATE_BOOKING`
- Hook: `useBookings()` provides state + dispatch access

### Persistence
- Bookings are also stored in **localStorage**
- Hook: `useLoadInitialBookingsData()`
    - Loads data from localStorage if available
    - Otherwise fetches mock data from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`
- Hook: `useUpdateBookingsInLocalStorage()`
    - Syncs localStorage whenever bookings state changes
- Hook: `useResetBookingsData()`
    - Re-fetches data from API and resets both state and localStorage
